# Large Arithmetic Collider FAQ

**My code passes the 4th test for `solve`, but none of the first three. Does this mean my code is correct?**

No, the fourth test for `solve` just tests that your `solve` function returns _something_ for every grid in the simple grids campaign. It does not validate that those results are correct. The other three tests check that results returned by your `solve` function are correct. In general, you need to pass all tests for a given function or there is guaranteed to be something wrong with your implementation.
